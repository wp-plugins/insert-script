With the [insert_script] shortcode you can call on other local code.
== Description ==

With the [insert_script] shortcode, this calls on the absolute path of any script from the path you provide with the "path=" attribute.
It can also pass along declared variables from a "vars=" attribute where you can define GET values in URL safe declarations -- whatever
the script you are calling on requires.  This allows a level of back-end integration with code, processes, and data outside of Wordpress.


== Installation ==

1. Upload `insert_script` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
